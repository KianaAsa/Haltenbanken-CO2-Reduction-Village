Nowadays we face a climate and energy challenge that needs to be addressed as quickly as possible.
In order to comply with the 2015 Paris Agreement we need to find better and innovative ways
that tackle emission reductions in accordance with the best available science to achieve a balance
between manmade emissions and affordable energy, while making a profit at the same time.
Attaining the Paris Agreement’s most ambitious targets now necessitates swift, deep, and longterm reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions. This includes a 45 percent reduction in global
carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, and a net zero by mid-century, as well
as significant reductions in other greenhouse gases like methane. The Pact also emphasizes the
need of safeguarding, conserving, and restoring the environment and ecosystems, as well as the
need for a rapid scale-up and deployment of clean power generation and energy-efficiency measures
[1].
While the need to address climate change is apparent, so is the world’s economy’s dependence
on reliable and affordable energy. Fast-growing developing nations are navigating a period of
urbanisation and industrialisation that has historically been energy and carbon heavy. When
energy markets are out of balance, as seen in late 2021 and early 2022 (due to the COVID19
pandemic), developed countries have gone through shocks and dislocations, resulting in personal,
political, and economic implications. Governments, businesses, investors, and individuals will have
to strike a delicate and challenging balance between guaranteeing quick emission reductions and
assuring the continuous provision of reliable and inexpensive energy as they take on the urgent
issue of getting to net zero emissions.
The world will need to manage the risks of a disorderly transition while trying to limit the threats
of climate change. The energy transition will require governments to make bold policy decisions in
order for it to succeed. It will necessitate corporations taking new risks and investors supporting
them in doing so. It will necessitate certain changes in consumer behavior. Above all, success will
necessitate collaboration, courage, trust, and a shared commitment [1].
This project aims to deal with some of the issues raised above. Here we propose an integrated
solution that can offer companies and investors insight on how they can further develop and invest
towards a future that aims to reduce the CO2 emissions related to the oil and gas industry (both
direct and indirect emissions).
